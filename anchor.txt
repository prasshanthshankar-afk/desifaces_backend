here are the latest headlines making news today, Tuesday, January 27th, 2026.

We begin in the United States, where a powerful winter storm system is still leaving a major impact across multiple regions. Millions have been dealing with dangerous cold, significant snow and ice, widespread power outages, and major travel disruption. Airlines have faced ongoing cancellations and delays as crews and aircraft reposition after the worst of the storm. Utilities in several states are still working to restore service, and officials are urging people to take cold-weather safety seriously — especially where power remains out and indoor heating is limited.

Turning now to the political and legal fallout in Minnesota: a federal judge has ordered the acting director of ICE to appear in court, warning of possible contempt over what the judge described as repeated failures to comply with court orders — including requirements tied to immigration detention proceedings. The move comes amid heightened scrutiny of federal immigration enforcement activity in the state, and broader tensions surrounding operations and oversight.

And in related developments, Reuters reports the White House is weighing changes in posture in Minneapolis as it faces intensified public pressure and political blowback tied to the recent enforcement surge.

Overseas now — and a major development in global trade: India and the European Union have finalized a landmark trade agreement, after negotiations stretching back years. Leaders on both sides are calling it a historic deal expected to reshape tariffs and market access between two of the world’s largest economic blocs. The agreement still faces legal and ratification steps, but it’s already being framed as a strategic pivot in an era of shifting global trade relationships.

In East Asia, North Korea launched short-range ballistic missiles into waters off its east coast, according to regional officials. The launches drew condemnation in the region and are being watched closely as part of a broader pattern of weapons testing. Analysts say the timing may also connect to North Korea’s internal political calendar and its effort to project strength.

Next, a troubling humanitarian and geopolitical story: in Iran, reports continue to emerge about the scale of a crackdown tied to protests and unrest — along with major economic disruption linked to internet restrictions and blackout conditions. Reuters has reported both the strain on Iranian businesses and accounts involving detentions — including allegations that protesters have been detained while receiving medical care. Information remains difficult to verify independently in real time, and figures cited by different sources vary.

Now to business and markets. U.S. stocks pushed higher today with the S&P 500 hitting a record, driven in part by corporate earnings and continued optimism in parts of the tech sector. At the same time, some major health insurers fell sharply amid a Medicare-related policy proposal that pressured the sector. Investors are also watching the Federal Reserve closely as the central bank meets this week, with many economists expecting interest rates to hold steady — and plenty of attention on how policymakers communicate the path ahead.

In tech, it’s a big week as major companies report earnings — and Reuters notes investors are pressing for clearer returns on the enormous wave of AI spending across the industry. The questions: which firms are turning investment into growth, and whether the “AI trade” still has room to run.

And one of the biggest online disruptions today: TikTok says a power outage at a U.S. data center triggered a cascading systems failure, causing widespread glitches — including issues affecting posting, engagement metrics, and recommendation feeds. The outage is also colliding with a political storm: Reuters reports California Governor Gavin Newsom is accusing TikTok of suppressing content critical of President Trump and has launched a state-level review, while TikTok attributes the issues to the technical failure.

Before we go, a quick reminder: many of today’s biggest stories are still developing — from storm recovery, to court proceedings, to international tensions — and we’ll continue following updates as new information is confirmed.
